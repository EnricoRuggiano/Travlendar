,,,
M7- Notify with a Warning message if the route chosen by the User is not good and he/she may arrive on late at the 'Meeting' because of its Extimation Time too long.,"MR1- Before subitting the 'Event', the system must check if the time of the 'Event' and the 'Extimation' time of Arrival of the corrisponding 'Best Route' overlap with other 'Event' time start.",Route Module,
,,,
"M8- Suggest a ""Best Route"" to the User with a 'Vehicle' which is appropriate for the day time of the appointment, the geographical location, the type of the meeting and the weather
","MR1- The system must provide a ""Suggested Route""
